TestRepo
========

This is a repository that I can use to create interesting version histories
and git tree structures and for whatever else it is that I want to do.

Uninhibited Power!

The Plan
--------

I am making a few commits which mainly involve editing this file at this
point. The next step is to create a branch and start working on files in
the `doc` directory. Then I will commit and push those and do some stuff
back on the master branch as well. We will see where to go from there!
